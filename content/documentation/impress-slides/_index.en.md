LibreOffice Impress is a powerful open-source alternative to PowerPoint and works very well to prepare lecture slides as PDFs for use with our software. This guide explains the most important export options, how to deal with animations, and why exporting notes from Impress often works better.

### Why LibreOffice Impress?
- Open source, free, and cross-platform.
- Very good PDF export with many configuration options.
- Speaker notes can be exported as PDF comments, which in practice works more reliably than in PowerPoint.
