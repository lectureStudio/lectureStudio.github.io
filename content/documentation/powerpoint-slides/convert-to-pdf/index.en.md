In case you have created your presentation with PowerPoint, you have several options for converting the PowerPoint slides into a PDF.

If your presentation has simple animations, you can use the [PPspliT](https://www.maxonthenet.altervista.org/ppsplit.php "_blank") tool. To do this, download and install the latest version of PPspliT. To use the tool, open the presentation in PowerPoint and search for *PPspliT* in the menu bar.

You can convert your presentation into a PDF with [LibreOffice](https://de.libreoffice.org/download/download/ "_blank") if you do not have PowerPoint. To do this, download and install the latest version of LibreOffice. Next, open the presentation with LibreOffice and convert it to PDF via the menu *File > Export as PDF*.
