In case you are splitting animations into multiple slides with PPspliT and have issues with preserving slide numbers, the instructions below describe how to solve that issue. The tool PPspliT has knowingly unsupported features regarding the preservation of slide numbers, if:
- you are operating on a PPTX file that is imported into PowerPoint <=2003 using the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack.
- you have slide numbers that appear in standard text boxes that were not defined in slide masters and inserted as headers/footers in the slide deck.

If you created your slides with newer versions of PowerPoint, then you can skip this part.

1. Switch to the slide master.
2. Remove text field for slide number.
